Module 3: Mission Planning in Driving Environments
KEY CONCEPTS
Recall the mathematical concept of a graph.
Understand how graphs can be used to represent road networks.
Apply Breadth First Search (BFS) to an unweighted graph to find the shortest path to a destination.
Apply Dijkstra's Search to a weighted graph for finding the shortest path in a more realistic road network.
Apply heuristics through A* Search to improve shortest path search speed.
