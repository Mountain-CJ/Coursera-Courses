Module 7: Putting it all together - Smooth Local Planning
KEY CONCEPTS
Recall the definition of parametric curves, motion planning constraints, and motion planning boundary conditions.
Understand the differences between spirals and splines, and the tradeoffs of using either.
Design optimization objectives suited to particular motion planning tasks.
Use Python libraries to solve optimization problems.
Implement a conformal lattice planner based on polynomial spiral optimization.
Compute a velocity profile constrained by curvature, speed limits, and dynamic obstacles.
