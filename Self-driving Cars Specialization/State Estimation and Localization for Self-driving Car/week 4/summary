Module 4: LIDAR Sensing
KEY CONCEPTS
Explain how LIDAR sensors are able to generate range data from time-of-flight measurements
Understand inverse and forward sensor models for a basic scanning LIDAR
Apply standard transfomations (translation, rotation, and scaling) to LIDAR point cloud data
Summarize how the problem of motion distortion can affect LIDAR scans acquired from a moving vehicle
Utilize the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to align point clouds from consecutive LIDAR scans
