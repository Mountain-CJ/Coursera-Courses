Module 3: GNSS/INS Sensing for Pose Estimation
KEY CONCEPTS
Explain the operation of the two most common sensors used for pose estimation in autonomous driving, inertial meaurement units and GNSS receivers.
Understand the concept of coordinate acceleration and the fundamental equation of inertial navigation.
Apply gyroscope and accelerometer measurement models in the context of navigation.
Describe the process of trilateration and justify why four satellites must be visible to obtain a 3D position fix from a GPS (GNSS) receiver.
Understand why ionospheric delays and multipath effects can degrade the performance of GPS.
