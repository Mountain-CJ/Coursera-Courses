Module 5: Putting It together - An Autonomous Vehicle State Estimator
KEY CONCEPTS
Apply filtering-based state estimation to determine the pose of a vehicle on the roadway
Use LIDAR scan registration (to an existing map) to improve state estimates
Test the effects of the loss of one or more sensors on the vehicle pose estimate
