Module 2: State Estimation - Linear and Nonlinear Kalman Filters
KEY CONCEPTS
Describe the relationship between least squares and the linear Kalman filter
Explain the (in)sensitivity of the Kalman filter to new data and the need for process noise
Describe how the linear Kalman filter can be extended to nonlinear systems via linearization
Describe how the EKF uses first-order linearization to turn a nonlinear problem into a linear one
Contrast the linearization approach of the EKF with that of the UKF, and explain why the UKF is superior for many problems
Assess the performance of the extended Kalman filter and its variants
