This module introduces the main concepts from the broad field of computer vision needed to progress 
through perception methods for self-driving vehicles. The main components include camera models and their calibration, 
monocular and stereo vision, projective geometry, and convolution operations.

KEY CONCEPTS
Review the layout of the courses in the Specialization
Review the main projects offered in this course


Module 1: Basics of 3D Computer Vision
KEY CONCEPTS
Build a pinhole camera model and define the model parameters to be found in calibration
Define the projective geometry required to interpret points in 3D as observed in the image plane
Formulate the equations and constraints for stereo sensors
Compute disparity from rectified images
Understand cross-correlation, convolutions, the difference between them, and what they are used for
