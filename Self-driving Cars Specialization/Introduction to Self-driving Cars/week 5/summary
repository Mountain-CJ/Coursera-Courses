Module 5: Vehicle Longitudinal Control
Longitudinal control of an autonomous vehicle involves tracking a speed profile along a fixed path, 
and can be achieved with reasonable accuracy using classic control techniques. 
This week, you will learn how to develop a baseline controller that is applicable for a significant subset of driving conditions,
which include most non-evasive or highly-dynamic motions.
